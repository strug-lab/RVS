Robust Variance Score

The robust variance score (RVS) is a likelihood-based method/test
to compute p-values to analyze and interpret genetic association
data.  It substitutes genotype calls by their expected values
given observed sequence data.

RVS eliminates read depth bias in the estimation of minor allele
frequency. It controls Type I error and has comparable power to
the 'gold standard' analysis with the true underlying genotypes
for both common and rare variants.
